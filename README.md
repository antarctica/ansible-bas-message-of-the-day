# Message Of The Day (`motd`)

Configures the message of the day shown when logging into a machine

## Overview

* Replaces the default message of the day with a custom value containing information on the infrastructure, operating 
system, operating system image and identifier in the BAS Systems Inventory for the machine
* Retains information on the last login
* On Ubuntu machines, retains system update notices

### Intended Audience

This role is designed to meet the needs of BAS projects only, it is not intended to be a generic role.
Consequently this role may not suit the needs of other users or teams. This is not considered a limitation.

BAS also produces a number of roles, which are intended to be generic, within the BAS Ansible Roles Collection (BARC).
See [here](https://galaxy.ansible.com/detail#/user/18670) for available roles, 
and [here](https://antarctica.hackpad.com/BARC-Overview-and-Policies-SzcHzHvitkt) for a general overview and policies.

## Quality Assurance

This role uses manual testing to ensure the features offered by this role work as advertised. 
See tests/README.md for more information.

### Source code

All changes should be committed, via pull request, to the canonical repository, which for this project is:

`ssh://git@stash.ceh.ac.uk:7999/WSF/ansible-role-message-of-the-day.git`

A mirror of this repository is maintained on GitHub. Changes are automatically pushed from the canonical repository to
this mirror, in a one-way process.

### Contributing policy

This project welcomes contributions, see `CONTRIBUTING.md` for our general policy.

The [Git flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow/) 
workflow is used to manage the development of this project:

* Discrete changes should be made within feature branches, created from and merged back into develop 
(where small changes may be made directly)
* When ready to release a set of features/changes, create a release branch from develop, update documentation as 
required and merge into master with a tagged, semantic version (e.g. v1.2.3)
* After each release, the master branch should be merged with develop to restart the process
* High impact bugs can be addressed in hotfix branches, created from and merged into master (then develop) directly
