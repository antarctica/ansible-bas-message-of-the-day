# Setup infrastructure for testing role

# Apply role to test VMs,
# host-vars are used to control which features of the role are applied to each VM.
# For each test a set of tasks will be run to check the selected features of roles are correctly applied.

# There are no automated tests for this role as reading the 'Message Of The Day' from within Ansible is not trivial.
# Therefore manual verification is required by logging into each test machine.

# Normally the 'motd_information_systems_inventory_identifer' variable would be set as a host_var or inventory variable
