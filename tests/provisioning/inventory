# This is an Ansible inventory file. It inherits from /etc/ansible/hosts if it exists
# It organises hosts/nodes into logical groups which can then be used in playbooks

# This inventory is for all environments

# It is best practice to group hosts by location and purpose like so:

[local]
localhost
